## üí° Pro Tips for Resume Usage

### DO:
‚úÖ **Quantify Results**: Use numbers (85% accuracy, 30fps, 60% reduction)  
‚úÖ **Action Verbs**: Start with strong verbs (Developed, Engineered, Architected, Implemented)  
‚úÖ **Be Specific**: Mention exact technologies (React 18, TypeScript, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)  
‚úÖ **Show Impact**: Explain how features benefit users or improve performance  
‚úÖ **Tailor to Job**: Pick 3-5 most relevant points for each position  

### DON'T:
‚ùå Copy all points verbatim - select what matches the job description  
‚ùå Use buzzwords without context ("leveraged synergies")  
‚ùå Forget to explain technical terms when applying to non-tech companies  
‚ùå Exaggerate - be honest about your contributions

## üé§ Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "I built ISL Bridge, an AI-powered web platform that helps deaf individuals communicate using Indian Sign Language. The app uses real-time computer vision with TensorFlow.js to recognize hand gestures from a webcam at 85% accuracy, translates them to text, and can also convert text back to sign language descriptions. I integrated Google's Gemini AI for natural language understanding and built the full stack using React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The platform processes video at 30 frames per second while keeping CPU usage low through optimizations like frame skipping and Web Workers. It's designed to be fully accessible and works on any device with a webcam."
